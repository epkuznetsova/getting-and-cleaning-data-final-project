Coursera: Final Project. Getting and Cleaning Data

Hello everyone! 
This is my final project for JHU Coursera Getting and Cleaning data! 

I attached R script file into rep: "run_analysis.R", it executes the following:


1. Read test and train data sets, labels and features from a directory
2. Merges the training and the test sets into new merged data sets.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. It is saved into file "tidydata.txt"

In the file "CodeBook.md" you can see description of all the variables, data and transformations with it.
